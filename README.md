# Personal studies and learning

Space dedicated to organizing my studies from various sources:
- Subjects from the Systems Analysis and Development course (Fatec);
- Extra and complementary courses;
- Study groups;
- Special topics;
- Book follow-up.

The goal of this repository is to organize all the subjects I'm currently learning and dedicating myself to, or subjects I've already studied and am reviewing.
